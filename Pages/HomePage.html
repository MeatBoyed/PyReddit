                  Moons have changed this sub. For the better or the worse, that is up to discussion. I want to talk about
                  the flaws of moons. Their psychological effect. Every I’ve seen in new has had 40+ comments in 30 minutes,
                  but all the posts I make rarely have 15+ upvotes. Not upvoting a post makes almost zero effect, in fact in
                  a post I’d seen before analysing karma and moons, not upvoting 1000 posts will only increase the number f
                  moons you receive 0.17% more moons, that’s 100.17 moons instead of 100. But people don’t care that they
                  barely change anything, they are greedy, and moons have magnified these issues 1000 fold. Edit: this post
                  has been live 3 minutes. It already has 11 comments but 1 upvote. This just further proves my statement
